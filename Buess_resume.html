	<h2  style='display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.1ex; margin-bottom: 0.0ex' data-availabiliy='1'>Objective:</h2>
	<div style='display: inline-block;'><span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%;'>night shift</span> / third shift, second shift, or great flexibility with 
		time-of-day working hours.  I am quite the night owl.

<section><h2 style='font-size: 160%; margin-bottom: 0.1ex; margin-top: 1.0ex; '>manufacturing / assembly cover letter (alpha v1, 2024/01/16 15:49)</h2>
	
	<p style='margin-top: 1ex;'>Lately I have only been applying for overnight manufacturing jobs.  My work experience is all in software, 
		but I am quite the night owl.  My loyalty has always 
		been to the dark side or 
		night side, not software.  (As I describe below, I seriously considered a mechanical path decades ago.)  
		For many years I have been a freelance software developer 
		so that I can work at night.  I do not have the sales skills to freelance, however; it's way past 
		time to concede defeat on that point.  I've had one client who will reach 8 years with me in a few weeks, but that has always been part-time.  I've had 
		other enthusiastic repeat clients, but it hasn't been enough.
	</p>
	
	<p>In early December I considered daytime software jobs again, but as soon as I saw more and more overnight manufacturing jobs when I moved to Gainesville, 
		I decided to have a go at those and put more time into that quest, including this cover letter.  
	</p>
	
	<p>In 1996 I was accepted to Chattahoochee Tech's automotive school; a mechanical path was on my mind then.  Apparently I didn't look at the details of the classes  until I was close to registering.  I saw two solid years of 8am classes, and I decided there had to be a better path for me.  I've never found that path, though, not 
		in terms of financial success.  (Given my lack of freelancing sales, $15 / hour for 40+ hours a week will be wild success.)
	</p>
	
	<p>I may have made a serious mistake going down the software path.  I'm going to try to escape the sunk-cost trap and start over.  
		
	</p>
	
	<p>I have never found steady night work, but all signs are that working at night will not feel like work. I enjoy building software, but I may enjoy building 
		physical objects even more.  As a solo freelancer, I've had to create and run my own quality assurance tests.  Even with the abstraction of software, I know what 
		it means to make a quality product.  It will be so much easier and take so much less energy to go down a pre-planned path of proven assembly steps and well-documented QA checks.  I'm sure I can become quite good at manufacturing.  Once I'm quite good at it, I'd love to do something that I am good at, is financially sustainable, and doesn't wear me out by getting up too early.  That will be quite the change.  
	</p>
	
	<p>Once I'm good at it, I can see doing this for several months.  After that, my vision becomes fuzzier.  I may be quite content to do assembly for years.  I can continue to do software on the side.  I would like to hear an 
		employer's medium-term cost-benefit.  If it helps me stay on the night shift, I would consider management, although that can only go so far on the night shift.
		Alternatively, my entire schooling and career has shown how quickly I learn.  There must be a more and more valuable path for both of us.  Someone 
		out there must want very talented people at night.  I haven't found the someone yet, but perhaps manufacturers are the someone.  
	</p>
	
	<p>In theory there exist nighttime tech jobs, but I've only see the theory of it so far, after some attempt at the practice.  I can't cover all the reasons I'm 
		pushing this path over others, so please ask me.  
		
	</p>
