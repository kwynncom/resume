<h1>regarding rewriting my resume - October 25, 2020</h1>

<p>The <a href='https://kwynn.com/t/3/02/Buess_resume.html'>current web incarnation of my resume</a> was posted in February, 2013, based on my "/t/3/02/" URL designation.  The Linux "ls -l" command says I haven't touched it since October 8, 2017, which sounds about right.  In case I decide to change the header, I am starting to write this page on October 25, 2020.
</p>

<p>It seems this will be part rant, part advice, part diary / journal, to name a few.  As is often the case, I'm not entirely sure who my intended audience is.  Consider this stream of thought; you've been warned.  
</p>

<p>So it's time to rewrite my resume.  I have been dreading and avoiding this for years.  So now I'll avoid it some more by ranting about it.  </p>

<p>I'm going to bold face my objectives for my own reference.  

</p>

<p>It's time because I am job / gig / project hunting like never before.  To some degree that's practice, to some degree intent.  I'm getting there.  Why I'm hunting like never before perhaps deserves its own essay: perhaps later.  The simplest message I need to change is to <b>add that I'm available</b>, and <b>add that message to a number of my web pages</b>, perhaps all of them.  I have considered writing a mini content management system for that.  (I despise the off-the-shelf content management systems, which would be yet another essay.)
</p>

<p>From the top, perhaps I should <b>downplay my location</b>.
